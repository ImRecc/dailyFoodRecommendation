Define Food and User Profiles (Structures)  
We will start by defining the data structures for food and user profiles.

Input System  
We'll write the code to allow users to input the food data (name, calories, protein, preferences) and store it.

Recommendation Logic  
We'll create the recommendation logic, including the greedy algorithm to match food with user requirements (calories, proteins, preferences).

Recommendation Selection  
Based on the user's selection (calories first, proteins first, or preferences), the system will recommend appropriate foods.

Handling Meals  
We will structure the program so that the recommendations fit within the userâ€™s 3:4:3 calorie ratio for three meals.

Main Application Loop  
We'll create the main loop where users can input their data and receive recommendations.
